# StreamProjects
A list of things TBD

This is a list of things that I'm doing to learn different aspects of the IT world that I'm not 100% knowledgable on or that solves a problem I'm currently having.
While the instance/server/container stuff is more up my alley, the programming is something I'll need to dig deeper in.

So this whole list is for me to try and visualize & document everything. 

# Pre-Projects
    * Setup projects list (This I assume)
    * Fix twitch section w/bots and lists to follow

# Full scaled projects
    * Finish building the server
        * New PSU
        * Storage
        * Maybe  RAM (Is 32GiB enough??)
    * Setup kubernetes cluster with the following services
        * Camera server (NVR)
        * Grafana server
        * Home-dashboard for internal services
        * PiHole
        * Wireguard VPN
    * Gitlab instance
    * Proxmox instance
    * Automate it all with something + ansible
    * Setup personal website
    * Setup 'tools' github docs w/ code
    * ~~Setup NVR camera server for testing before kube cluster~~
    * Setup dotfiles github page

# Programming structure
    * Finish 'Learn Python The Hard Way'
    * Finish Al's book "Automate the boring stuff"
    * Remake the NVR server
        * Containarize it
        * Enable local & remote file recordings
        * Use tensorflow or something to detect HOOMANS D:
    * Find a Javascript learning resource equals to 'Learn python the hard way'
        * Learn about node / nvm and basic JS/NODE package management
        * Learn about javascript frameworks (React, electon etc). A little bit depending on what the projects needds
    * Make two projects with JS and node
        * Make a SRS (Spaced Repetition System) with JS, could ideally be an Electron app
        * TBD 
    * Research and look into Developer handbooks containing best practices and read up

# Cloud
## The whole cloud category will focus on AWS primarly
    * Finish the DevOps course on aws
    * Finish the Terraform associate course from hashicorps

Things are bound to change alot here....
